###Outline
==Reading: Shaffer Ch. 7==
1. Sorting Background
2. Sorting Basics
3. Implementation

###Sorting Background
- Data stucture organizes data in memory
- Why:
	- certain methods of storing data
	- efficiency in time and space
	- large datasets greatly impact runtime
	- you might run out of memory
	- flexibility
	- intuitive understanding of a program
	- ease of implementation
- Sorting our data:
	- specific pattern
	- makes sense
	- ai <= aj, then ai appears before aj
- large data sets make sorting important
- sorting is still being researched
- Assumptions:
	- data in arrays
	- array is populated
	- sort in ascending order
	- data is integers
- Evaluations:
	- run time complexity
	- space complexity
	- ease of implementation
	- intuitive understanding
	- handle large data sets

###Sorting Basics
- **insertion sort**:
	- pick "next" element one at a time
	- put in correctly ordered position
- **selection sort**:
	- repeatedly choose smallest element
	- place it in next open slot
- **bubble sort**:
	- repeatedly compare element to its neighbor
	- swap if necessary
- **quicksort**:
	- pick one to be the middle
	- place elements in order on both sides
	- recursively sort both sides
- **mergesort**:
	- sort subarrays
	- merge to make a bigger, sorted array
