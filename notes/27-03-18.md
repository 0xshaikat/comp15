####Outline:
1. Graph Traversal
2. BFS Implementation

###Breadth First Search
- starting vertex s
- destination vertex d
- find all of s's neighbors
	- reachable in one step
	- is d one of them? then we're done!
- find all of s's neighbors (if we haven't already)
	- reachable in two steps?
	- is d one of them? (then we're done)
	
###Breadth First Search
- source s 
- destination d
- shortest path from s to d
- Graph class:
	- template s by vertex
	- Graph <string> q;
- edges are ints
- unweighted graph:
	- weight 1 = edge exists
- Attributes:
	- 1. array of vertices
	- 2. 2d array of edges
- BFS: 
	- non-member function
	- Auxiliary Structures
	- Q1: vertices ok to visit
	- Q2: neighbors of current vertex
	- Predecessor array: pred on BFSpath for each vertex
