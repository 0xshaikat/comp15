###Outline
1. Heap ADT
2. Heaps and inheritance
3. How heaps are used

####1. Heap ADT
- Heap properties
	1. Complete binary tree (every level except possibly bottom is filled)
	2. partially ordered (relationship between value at every node and the values of its children)
		- determine relative order of ancestor/descendant nodes but not any other relationship
- MinHeap: value at every node is less than or equal to children
	- smallest (or tied) value is the root
	- easy to find the smallest value (O(1))
	- once smallest value removed, heap properties have tok be restored
	- **insert**
		- needs to setup an efficient extraction
		- put new item in next slot
		- restore heap property
			- repeatedly compare new item to parent, swap if necessary
	- **extract**
		- return the value at root
		- put last item (rightmost item at the botoom row) at the root position
		- heapify down
			- repeatedly compare new root to children, and swap if necessary
- MaxHeap: value at every node is greater than or equal to children

####2. Heaps + Inheritance
- Heaps usually implement and underlying array
- Heap is a type of Binary Tree, but we don't inherit from Binary Tree class
- Abstract Heap Class is parent class of MaxHeap and MinHeap, which are derived
- Heap is an abstract class, so it cannot instantiate an object
							
		Heap h; //X :(
		MaxHeap<int> h; //:)
		MinHeap<string> h2; //:)

- **Heap.h**
	- make at least one function purely virtual
	
			virtual void heapify_up = 0; //purely virtual

####3. How Heaps are Used
- priority queues
- heapsort
	- put array elements into a Heap
	- repeatedly extract min
	- put elements in array or print
	- heap is an auxiliary
