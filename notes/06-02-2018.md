==Reading: Shaffer 4.3-4.3==
1. Copy  constructor and assignment operator
2. Queue ADT
3. Queue as linked structure


####I. Copy Constructor and Assignment Operator
- copy constructor invoked when we're making a new object
- assignment operator invoked when we replace an existing object

		LL myList; #invokes default constructor
		#myList is pushed on to stack
		#inserting into LL allocates nodes on the heap
		
		LL l2; #calls default constructor (on execution stack)
		
		l2 = myList #replacing calls assignment operator
		#not using assignment operator points l2 and myList 
		#to the same location in memory in the heap, so destructing one of them destructs both of them. calling the assignment operator makes a deep copy of the original myList and points l2 to it (2 pointers, 2 locations in memory)
		
		LL l3 = foo(myList) #invokes copy constructor, scope of copy constructor is in foo, and somewhere in heap, there will be a deep copy of myList that foo modifies , and original myList will be unaffected in main. After foo modifies this deep copy, l3 calls the copy constructor (not the assignment operator) because l3 did not exist in the first place. If l3 was declared originally, and then assigned to foo, then the assignment operator would be called
		
####II. Queue ADT
- Everything we care about
	- FIFO
- Don't care about:
	- if an item is in there
	- what item is at a position
	- the position of an item
	- sum of all items
	- deleting at position
- **enqueue** function inserts new item at back of list
- **dequeue** function removes item at front of list
- Queues are used in simulations:
	- COMP15 OFFICE HOURS
		- one queue
		- several TA's
		- would one queue per TA be better?
		- measure total time to help everyone
		- measure average wait time
		- measure how many people actually get helped (and rate)
		- measure differences in wait

####III. Queue Implementation
- Option 1: Underlying Linked Structure
	- every element is a node type
	- grows and shrinks dynamically
	-  **enqueue**:
		- allocate new NodeType
		- point rear to new node
		- point rear.next to new node	
	- **dequeue**:
		- does the above, in reverse
- Option 2: Underlying Array
