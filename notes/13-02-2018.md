###Outline
1. Binary Trees
2. Traversals and recursion
3. Helper functions

####1. Binary Trees
- every node has 0, 1, or 2 children
- a leaf is a node with no children
- root is at the top of the tree (entry point)
- a node has a  **depth** (number of levels away from root)
- a tree's height is the depth of the deepest node
- **Binary Search Tree**:
	- is a type of binary tree
	- no duplicates
	- can be unbalanced
	- but nicely sorted
	- anode is smaller than right subtree, but larger than left subtree
- BinaryNode struct:

		class BinaryTree //base class
		{
			public:
			
			protected; //instead of private
				BinaryNode *root;
		};
		
		class BST: public BT //derivedclass
		{
			public:
		};
		
		struct BinaryNode
		{
			int value;
			BinaryNode *left;
			BInaryNode *right;
		}//end struct
		
####2. Traversals + Recursion
- Functions the same for BT and BST
- structure, not values
- traversal 'visit' every node
- print every node of the tree
- recursive functions b/c a subtree is a binary tree
- base case (usally empty tree)
- recursive step (go left, or right)
- Pseudocode:
				
		Pre-order traversal pseudocode:
			-print root
			-recursively print left subtree
			- recurseivley print right subtree
		
		void print_pre(BinaryNode *tree, ostream &out)
		{
			if (tree == NULL)
				{
					return;
				{
				else
				{
					out << tree->value << endl;
					print_pre(BinaryNode tree->left, out);
					print_pre(BinaryNode tree->right, out);
				}
		}//end print_pre
